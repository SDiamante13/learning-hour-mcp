# Learning Hours Domain Vocabulary

## Core Concepts

### Learning Hour
A structured 60-minute session where teams practice technical skills using the 4C Learning Model. Sessions focus on one micro-skill to avoid overwhelming participants.

### Deliberate Practice
Focused, structured practice aimed at improvement. Includes immediate feedback, repetition of challenging elements, and progressive skill building.

### Technical Excellence
The continuous pursuit of high-quality software development practices that enhance team agility and software maintainability.

### Micro-skill
A small, focused technical ability that can be learned and practiced in a single Learning Hour session (e.g., "Extract Method" refactoring).

## 4C Learning Model Components

### Connect
The opening phase where participants activate prior knowledge and assess current understanding of the topic.

### Concept
The teaching phase where the facilitator introduces the main idea through explanation, demonstration, and examples.

### Concrete
The practice phase where participants apply the concept through hands-on coding exercises, typically in pairs or ensembles.

### Conclusion
The reflection phase where participants consolidate learning and identify key takeaways for future application.

## Technical Practices

### Test Driven Development (TDD)
Writing tests before implementation code, following the Red-Green-Refactor cycle.

### Refactoring
Improving code structure without changing external behavior. Common refactorings include Extract Method, Rename Variable, and Inline Function.

### Clean Code
Code that is readable, maintainable, and expressive. Achieved through good naming, small functions, and clear structure.

### Evolutionary Design
Allowing software architecture to emerge and evolve through iterative development and refactoring.

### Ensemble Programming
Collaborative programming approach where the entire team works together on the same code at the same time.

### Pair Programming
Two developers working together at one workstation, with one writing code (driver) and the other reviewing (navigator).

## Learning Session Components

### Learning Goals
Specific, measurable objectives that define what participants will achieve by the end of the session.

### Facilitator
The person guiding the Learning Hour, typically a technical coach or experienced team member.

### Code Kata
A coding exercise designed to practice specific programming techniques through repetition.

### Retrospective
Structured reflection on the learning session to identify insights and improvement opportunities.

## Quality Metrics

### Technical Debt
The implied cost of future reworking required when choosing quick solutions over better approaches.

### Deployment Frequency
How often the team releases software to production, indicating delivery capability.

### Defect Rate
The frequency of bugs or issues in delivered software, measuring quality.

### Cycle Time
The time from starting work on a feature to delivering it to users.

## Team Dynamics

### Psychological Safety
An environment where team members feel safe to take risks, make mistakes, and learn without fear of negative consequences.

### Collective Ownership
Shared responsibility for all code in the system, enabling any team member to modify any part.

### Continuous Improvement
The ongoing practice of identifying and implementing small enhancements to processes and skills.
