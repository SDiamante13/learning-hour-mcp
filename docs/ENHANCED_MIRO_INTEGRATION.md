## Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Miro Builder
The `EnhancedMiroBuilder` class provides:
- Sophisticated layout algorithms
- Color management system
- Interactive element placement
- Frame and shape creation
- Proper spacing and alignment

### Integration with Miro MCP
Uses the `@k-jarzyna/mcp-miro` package to access:
- `create_board`: Initialize new boards
- `create_sticky_note`: Add interactive notes
- `create_shape`: Build frames and containers
- `create_text`: Add instructions and labels
- `get_board`: Retrieve board links

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Generate a Learning Hour session
const session = await generator.generateSessionContent("Feature Envy", "workshop");

// Create an enhanced Miro board
const boardId = await enhancedMiroBuilder.createEnhancedBoard(session);
```
