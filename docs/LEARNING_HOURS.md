# Learning Hours: Technical Excellence Through Deliberate Practice

## Vision

Learning Hours are structured practice sessions where software teams develop technical excellence skills through deliberate practice. Just as athletes and pilots dedicate time to practice their craft, software developers need dedicated time to master fundamental programming practices that stand the test of time.

## Core Philosophy

> "Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility"
> - The 9th principle of the Agile Manifesto

Learning Hours focus on timeless technical practices rather than chasing new technologies:
- Test Driven Development (TDD)
- Refactoring
- Clean Code
- Evolutionary Design
- Pairing/Mobbing
- Continuous Integration/Delivery (CI/CD)

## The 4C Learning Model

Learning Hours follow the 4C Learning Model from "Training from the Back of the Room" by Sharon Bowman:

### Connect (5-10 minutes)
- Activate prior knowledge
- Assess team's current understanding
- Create psychological safety for learning

### Concept (15-20 minutes)
- Introduce the main idea concisely
- Use stories, visuals, and examples
- Demonstrate the technique or practice

### Concrete (20-30 minutes)
- Practice together as pairs or ensemble
- Apply the concept to real coding exercises
- Focus on one micro-skill at a time

### Conclusion (5-10 minutes)
- Reflect on learning and insights
- Define key takeaways
- Plan application to daily work

## Learning Goals Structure

Each Learning Hour begins with clear learning objectives:
- Remember specific terminology or concepts
- Identify situations for applying techniques
- Demonstrate practical implementation

## Outcomes

Teams practicing Learning Hours experience:
- Frequent deployments with minimal defects
- Faster development velocity
- Higher quality software delivery
- Improved team morale and collaboration
- Reduced technical debt

## Frequency

- **Optimal**: Daily Learning Hours (maximum results)
- **Recommended**: Weekly 2-hour sessions
- **Minimum**: Bi-weekly 1-hour sessions

Regular practice creates lasting behavioral change and skill development.

## Implementation

Learning Hours require minimal setup:
- Dedicated time slot (30-60 minutes minimum)
- Shared development environment
- Pre-selected learning objectives
- Code exercises or examples
- Retrospective and reflection time
