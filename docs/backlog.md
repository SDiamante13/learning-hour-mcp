## Epic 1: Team Codebase Integration (HIGHEST IMPACT)
*Transform generic Learning Hours into team-specific sessions using actual codebases*

### Story 1.1: Repository Analysis for Learning Opportunities
```gherkin
Feature: Repository Analysis for Learning Opportunities  
  As a Technical Coach using Claude
  I want Claude to analyze our team's actual codebase
  So that Learning Hour examples come from code we maintain daily

  Scenario: Finding real code smell examples
    Given I ask Claude "analyze our GitHub repo for Feature Envy examples"
    When Claude invokes the analyze_repository tool
    Then it should scan the codebase for Feature Envy patterns
    And return 3-5 real code examples with file paths and line numbers
    And include confidence scores and complexity ratings
    And suggest which examples work best for different experience levels
    And Claude should present these as "Here are Feature Envy examples from your actual codebase..."

  Scenario: Generating team-specific refactoring examples
    Given Claude found Feature Envy in src/UserService.java:45-67
    When I ask "create a Learning Hour using this example"
    Then Claude should generate before/after code using the actual methods
    And preserve the team's coding style and naming conventions
    And reference actual classes and business logic (anonymized)
    And show how the refactoring improves this specific codebase
    And create session content that says "Let's improve our UserService class"

  Scenario: Protecting sensitive business information
    Given our codebase contains proprietary algorithms and sensitive data
    When Claude analyzes for learning examples
    Then it should automatically anonymize business-specific names
    And replace sensitive constants with placeholder values
    And preserve technical structure while removing domain context
    And flag any examples that cannot be safely anonymized
    And ask for permission before including potentially sensitive code
```

### Story 1.2: Technology Stack Adaptation
```gherkin
Feature: Technology Stack Adaptation
  As a Technical Coach
  I want Learning Hour content adapted to our team's technology choices
  So that examples use frameworks and patterns we actually work with

  Scenario: Detecting team's technology profile
    Given I provide Claude with our repository URL
    When Claude invokes the analyze_tech_stack tool
    Then it should identify primary programming languages
    And detect main frameworks (React, Spring Boot, Django, etc.)
    And identify testing frameworks and build tools in use
    And note architectural patterns (REST APIs, microservices, etc.)
    And store this as reusable team context for future sessions

  Scenario: Generating stack-specific examples  
    Given our team uses "Node.js with Express and Jest"
    When I ask Claude "create a Clean Code Learning Hour"
    Then examples should use Express route handlers and middleware
    And JavaScript/TypeScript patterns our team recognizes
    And Jest testing examples that match our existing test structure
    And Node.js-specific refactoring opportunities
    And reference packages we already use (lodash, moment, etc.)

  Scenario: Learning path recommendations based on tech stack
    Given our tech profile shows "React with Redux and RTK Query"
    When I ask Claude "what should we learn next after completing TDD basics?"
    Then suggestions should prioritize React-specific testing patterns
    And Redux state management testing strategies
    And component testing with React Testing Library
    And API mocking patterns that work with RTK Query
```

## Epic 2: Adaptive Learning Intelligence
*Enable Claude to remember learning context and provide intelligent recommendations over time*

### Story 2.1: Learning Session History and Context
```gherkin
Feature: Learning Session History and Context
  As a Technical Coach using Claude
  I want Claude to remember our previous Learning Hours
  So that future sessions build logically on past learning

  Scenario: Recording completed sessions
    Given I tell Claude "we completed the TDD basics session last week"
    When Claude invokes the record_session_outcome tool
    Then it should store that this team completed TDD basics
    And note the date and any specific feedback I provide
    And associate this with the team's repository context
    And update the team's learning progression profile

  Scenario: Getting intelligent next session recommendations
    Given our team has completed "TDD Basics" and "Red-Green-Refactor"
    When I ask Claude "what should we learn next?"
    Then Claude should invoke get_learning_recommendations
    And suggest logical follow-up topics like "TDD with Legacy Code"
    And explain why each suggestion builds on previous learning
    And prioritize topics that address gaps identified in past sessions
    And consider our team's technology stack and codebase complexity

  Scenario: Adapting content based on team struggles
    Given I tell Claude "the team struggled with writing testable code during our TDD session"
    When I ask for the next Learning Hour topic
    Then Claude should prioritize topics like "Dependency Injection" or "Test Doubles"
    And suggest revisiting TDD concepts with simpler examples
    And recommend preparatory activities to address the identified struggle
    And adjust difficulty levels for future TDD-related content
```

### Story 2.2: Team Learning Profile Management
```gherkin
Feature: Team Learning Profile Management
  As a Technical Coach
  I want Claude to maintain context about each team's learning journey
  So that recommendations become more personalized over time

  Scenario: Building team learning profiles
    Given I'm coaching multiple teams with Claude
    When I specify which team I'm asking about
    Then Claude should maintain separate learning profiles for each team
    And track their completed topics, struggled areas, and skill progression
    And remember their technology stack and codebase characteristics
    And note their preferred learning styles and session formats

  Scenario: Generating experience-appropriate content
    Given our team profile shows "completed 8 Learning Hours, strong in testing, weak in refactoring"
    When I ask Claude to generate content for "Strategy Pattern"
    Then it should create intermediate-level content (not beginner)
    And include more refactoring practice since that's a weak area
    And reference testing patterns they already know well
    And use examples from their technology stack

  Scenario: Cross-team learning insights
    Given I coach multiple teams using Claude
    When I ask "which teams would benefit from a Clean Code session?"
    Then Claude should analyze all team profiles
    And identify teams that haven't covered Clean Code recently
    And suggest which teams might benefit from group sessions together
    And recommend different approaches based on each team's experience level
```

  Scenario: Identifying learning opportunities from recent PRs
    Given I ask Claude "what Learning Hour topics would help our team based on recent code reviews?"
    When Claude invokes the analyze_recent_prs tool
    Then it should scan the last 20 pull requests for common patterns
    And identify recurring code review comments about naming, complexity, testing
    And suggest Learning Hour topics that address the most frequent issues
    And provide specific examples from the PRs (anonymized) to use in sessions

  Scenario: Generating improvement-focused sessions
    Given recent PRs show frequent comments about "long parameter lists"
    When I ask Claude to create a Learning Hour for this issue
    Then it should generate content specifically about "Parameter Object" refactoring
    And use actual examples from our recent commits (anonymized)
    And show before/after using our team's coding style
    And explain how this addresses the specific review feedback patterns

  Scenario: Tracking improvement over time
    Given we completed a Learning Hour on "Method Naming" 4 weeks ago
    When I ask Claude "has our code review feedback improved since the naming session?"
    Then it should analyze recent PRs compared to pre-session PRs
    And identify whether naming-related comments have decreased
    And suggest follow-up topics if issues persist
    And highlight success stories where the learning was applied
```

### Story 3.2: Difficulty and Experience Adaptation
```gherkin
Feature: Difficulty and Experience Adaptation
  As a Technical Coach using Claude
  I want content automatically adapted to team experience levels
  So that sessions are appropriately challenging without being overwhelming

  Scenario: Auto-detecting team experience from codebase
    Given Claude analyzes our team's codebase
    When it evaluates code complexity, testing patterns, and architecture
    Then it should infer whether this is a beginner, intermediate, or advanced team
    And note specific strengths (good testing) and weaknesses (complex methods)
    And use this context to automatically adjust content difficulty
    And recommend appropriate starting points for different topics

  Scenario: Generating experience-appropriate examples
    Given our team profile shows "advanced in testing, intermediate in design patterns"
    When I ask Claude to create a "Strategy Pattern" Learning Hour
    Then it should assume familiarity with testing concepts
    And focus more time on design pattern implementation
    And use testing examples that leverage our advanced testing skills
    And provide design pattern exercises at intermediate difficulty

  Scenario: Progressive complexity in learning paths
    Given we've completed basic TDD and are ready for advanced topics
    When I ask Claude "what's next in our TDD journey?"
    Then it should suggest "TDD with Legacy Code" or "Outside-In TDD"
    And explain how these build on our established TDD foundation
    And provide exercises that challenge us beyond basic red-green-refactor
    And include techniques for handling complex real-world scenarios
```

    When I ask Claude "create GitHub issues for applying this learning"
    Then Claude should invoke the create_github_issues tool
    And create issues for refactoring opportunities found in our codebase
    And tag them with "learning-hour" and "refactoring" labels
    And include links to the Learning Hour content and examples
    And assign them to appropriate team members based on their experience

  Scenario: Tracking learning application in pull requests
    Given our team learned about "Single Responsibility Principle" last week
    When I ask Claude "has the team applied SRP in recent pull requests?"
    Then Claude should analyze recent PRs for SRP improvements
    And identify commits that demonstrate applying the learning
    And highlight missed opportunities for applying SRP
    And suggest gentle reminders or follow-up topics if needed

  Scenario: Learning-driven code review suggestions
    Given we have a Learning Hour session planned on "Clean Code"
    When I ask Claude "what should we focus on in this week's code reviews?"
    Then Claude should suggest specific Clean Code principles to watch for
